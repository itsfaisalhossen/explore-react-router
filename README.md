# 🚦 React Router Exploration

A simple and practical React project built to explore and understand the core concepts of React Router — including routing, nested routes, loaders, dynamic routes, and navigation handling.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project serves as a learning playground for experimenting with React Router features. It demonstrates how modern client-side routing works in React apps using the latest React Router v7 syntax.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🏠 **Basic Routing** – Setup of multiple pages and navigation.

- 🔁 **Nested Routes** – Organized and dynamic component structure.

- 🧭 **Dynamic Routing** – Route parameters and loader data fetching.

- 🧩 **Layout Routes** – Shared layouts and elements between routes.

- ⚡ **Data API (Loader & Action)** – Fetch data directly via route loaders.

- 🧱 **Error Boundaries** – Handling and displaying route-level errors.
